Inspired by Robert Dunn's composition classes at the Cunningham studio from 1960-1962, the Judson Dance Theater questioned and rebelled against ingrained values, forms, and presentational contexts. In this spirit, members of the Judson movement rejected technical virtuosity, embraced \"pedestrian\" movement and combined different techniques to initiate a period of \"eclecticism\" within American modern dance. In this course, students will experience material inspired by this movement, focusing upon expanding their spatial parameters and incorporating weight and breath into full-bodied explorations."

Next, it outlines the relationship between rap, dub, and hip-hop, and determines who the key figures of this global movement are. In reconstructing the growth and key moments of this life form, we will examine the myriad dimensions of this culture, through its music, music videos, dance styles, and films."

We consider some of the issues that underpin hip hop practice, such as its global circulation, its appropriation by the media, and its capacity to articulate ideas of community and identity. Students will work on increasingly advanced knowledge of the form across five hip hop styles: breaking, locking, popping, house and hip hop social dances. Students will further develop rhythmic awareness and improvisational techniques, in addition to cyphering and battling strategies."

Not only do people listen (how could we avoid it if we even wanted to?) but we also engage in heated debates about controversies in this music. Why are people angry about Miley Cyrus and Iggy Azalea's performances of black musical styles? Is Kanye West a compelling presidential candidate? Why was the first Billboard topping hip hop album by a white group? How has country music become so important to patriotism and why does it focus on white performers? Why do artists like Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga draw heated debates from both feminists and also sexists? In this course we will explore what these conversations reveal about our values and the social, economic, and technological forces shaping our lives. We will engage with songs; we'll read selections from journalism, artists' autobiographies, and scholarship; you'll observe a concert of your choice and interview a listener of your choice; and you will craft a playlist about a social issue that's important to you. In the process, you'll learn ways to approach these materials critically and engage with the tension between listener expectations of authenticity from our favorite musicians and the music industry's desire to make as much money as possible. The materials span several genres of music listened to in the United States in the last 100 years. No musical experience is required. The course will include short writing and creative assignments, a midterm, and a final exam."

Why are people angry about Miley Cyrus and Iggy Azalea's performances of black musical styles? Is Kanye West a compelling presidential candidate? Why was the first Billboard topping hip hop album by a white group? How has country music become so important to patriotism and why does it focus on white performers? Why do artists like Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga draw heated debates from both feminists and also sexists? In this course we will explore what these conversations reveal about our values and the social, economic, and technological forces shaping our lives. We will engage with songs; we'll read selections from journalism, artists' autobiographies, and scholarship; you'll observe a concert of your choice and interview a listener of your choice; and you will craft a playlist about a social issue that's important to you. In the process, you'll learn ways to approach these materials critically and engage with the tension between listener expectations of authenticity from our favorite musicians and the music industry's desire to make as much money as possible. The materials span several genres of music listened to in the United States in the last 100 years. No musical experience is required. The course will include short writing and creative assignments, a midterm, and a final exam."

Not only do people listen (how could we avoid it if we even wanted to?) but we also engage in heated debates about controversies in this music. Why are people angry about Miley Cyrus and Iggy Azalea's performances of black musical styles? Is Kanye West a compelling presidential candidate? Why was the first Billboard topping hip hop album by a white group? How has country music become so important to patriotism and why does it focus on white performers? Why do artists like Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga draw heated debates from both feminists and also sexists? In this course we will explore what these conversations reveal about our values and the social, economic, and technological forces shaping our lives. We will engage with songs; we'll read selections from journalism, artists' autobiographies, and scholarship; you'll observe a concert of your choice and interview a listener of your choice; and you will craft a playlist about a social issue that's important to you. In the process, you'll learn ways to approach these materials critically and engage with the tension between listener expectations of authenticity from our favorite musicians and the music industry's desire to make as much money as possible. The materials span several genres of music listened to in the United States in the last 100 years. No musical experience is required. The course will include short writing and creative assignments, a midterm, and a final exam."

The course will cover the important theories of language development and the developmental course of language acquisition. Woven throughout the class will be a discussion of dual language learners and ESL learners as they encounter the task of reading at the same time that they may be learning to speak English. Early childhood classroom activities will be discussed in relation to the six critical language and pre-literacy precursors suggested by the National Early Literacy Panel (2009). A unique emphasis is on the children's language and literacy development from birth to 6 years of age. There has been a dramatic shift in how early childhood language and pre-literacy development is perceived, taught, and learned. However, these new theoretical understandings have not translated into effective classroom practices. Through current readings and class discussion the following questions will be addressed: How should we think about language and the learning and teaching of literacy? How will we prepare young children for a world in which reading, specifically vocabulary development and comprehension will be increasingly important? How can activities be developed that embody the changes in reading teaching and learning advocated by recent recommendations? How can we form these changes to include all children, especially children in poverty and ESL children? NOTE: Background clearances required."

This course follows Child Development and is taken in conjunction with Cognition and Learning because we will work on applying these ideas about how children learn and grow in service of creating an optimal environment to foster this change. Specifically, this course will address relationship-building approaches and classroom management techniques and strategies that have been shown to promote resiliency, and mediate/moderate risk factors. Course work will focus on prevention of learner problem situations, preparation to deal with learner problem situations that cannot always be prevented, and proactively responding to learner problem situations in the future, all in the context of developmentally appropriate practices for young learners. Prevention content will explore how to create a classroom ecology that promotes safety and access to the social and academic curriculum; creating a positive and psychologically safe classroom climate; establishing relationships; using class rules and routines; and making instructional and curricular decisions that foster pro-social and emotional growth along with positive academic outcomes. Preparation to deal with concerns as they arise will include collaborative problem-solving for group and individual interventions (e.g., conflict resolution, social skills). Content on how to proactively respond to problem situations in the future will include methods on how to collaborate in the design, implementation, and monitoring of individual interventions for young learners with challenging behaviors, regardless of disability classification status and the role and function of early childhood educators in crisis responding. Across these topic areas, we will discuss how to adjust real-world techniques to a variety of children (i.e., taking a focus on every child), with attention to gender, ethnicity, language learning status, special needs, or levels of classroom engagement and attention.

The core curriculum for reading education should equip graduating teachers with the theoretical and practical knowledge to teach young children how to read and comprehend written text and to produce readers who are successful in the classroom and on standardized tests and use reading effectively to negotiate the world. There is growing consensus around a set of six foundational elements that teachers must use to produce proficient readers that should be included in any systematic program of study. These six foundational elements-- foundations in theory and research, word-level instructional strategies, text-level comprehension strategies, reading and writing connections, Instructional approaches and materials, and integrated assessment-- are the key components of the syllabus. Current research has provided important insight into how young children acquire literacy skill-- reading, writing, and comprehension of text. However, these new theoretical understandings have not entirely translated into effective classroom practices. Through current readings and class discussion the following questions will be addressed: How should we think about reading and the teaching of reading? How will we motivate young children to learn to read? How do we approach instruction for children who are struggling to learn to read? How do we prepare young children to approach different types of text and text from different subject areas? How can classroom activities be developed that emphasize reading and comprehension?

Evaluations supply information to program managers and policymakers that can assist them in making decisions about which programs to fund, modify, expand or eliminate. Evaluation can be an accountability tool for program managers and funders. Programs need answers to many questions (i.e., Who is a program intended to serve? What are its goals? What does the program actually look like? Who does it actually reach? What are the outcomes for those who received the intervention? How can a program be improved to better meet its goals? What needs to be adapted for a different population or setting? Why should a program continue to be funded? Which intervention works better? Which is more cost-effective?). This course serves as an introduction to evaluation methodology and evaluation tools commonly used to assess programs. Students will become familiar with the concepts, methods and applications of evaluation research; learn how to read evaluation research critically; understand how to use evaluation results to improve program performance; and be able to propose and execute an appropriate evaluation plan to assess the implementation and/or effectiveness of a program. There is no specific policy or sector focus to this course, as evaluation tools are used in all policy areas and by public (government) and private (foundation) funders as well as by public and private sector program managers. Students are encouraged to relate the general material of the course to their specific interests.

There is hardly a place on earth not part of the recreational geography of tourism. In practical terms, tourism is seen as an engine of economic growth both in the cities and in the countryside. While it moves people from one place to another, tourism produces itself with ever-greater complexity. This course will undertake an analysis of tourist productions, including tourist discourse, settings, events, experiences, and artifacts. An exemplary case of cultural invention and commodification, tourism is implicated in the histories of pilgrimage, travel, colonialism, and ethnography, retracing their trips and replicating their discourse, As a result, tourism offers some of the richest material for exploring the semiosis of cultural production on a global scale. In this course, therefore, we will pay special attention to the political economy of tourism as seen through a close analysis of actual sites."

At the outset, we will also examine social mobility patterns and how these objective categories of class are related to race, region, sex, and gender. We will then spend time looking at how class is lived and how it is represented in the larger culture. We will explore how social class shapes the daily lives of ordinary Americans in cities, suburbs, small towns, and rural hinterlands through such things as housing, community, work, leisure activities, shopping tastes, dress, diet, language, education, and family.

Some of this change resulted from the release of energy held in check by the Great Depression and World War II; some resulted from new technologies such as television and new spatial arrangements such as suburbanization; and some resulted from the emergence of new voices and styles (e.g., Abstract Expressionism, Rock and Roll, the Beats, bebop and other jazz forms) and more strenuous demands for freedom and equality by long-oppressed groups.

Our purpose will be to explore how culture in its many forms and manifestations shaped how people lived their daily lives and created meaning in a specific moment or set of circumstances.

Particular emphasis will be placed on looking at the relationship, and even the disconnect, between different kinds of culture - knowledge production and education, visual culture, including art, photography, and film, music, landscapes, and built environments. In order to do that, we will learn how to read, broadly construe, and understand how different cultural forms convey messages and how distinct ways of seeing and hearing relate to other cultural forms.

They will learn to understand them in their broader social, aesthetic, ethical, and political contexts. In addition, this class, as an introduction, will prepare students to take more advanced courses in American Studies.

Honors Language and Culture.  3   Credit Hours.": "Linguistic anthropology, one of the four subfields of anthropology, is the interdisciplinary study of the relationships among language, culture, and society. Linguistic anthropology shares many of its basic units of analysis, and some of its working concepts, with linguistics, especially the subfield of sociolinguistics. However, unlike most linguistic approaches, which are mainly concerned with language structure, linguistic anthropology is rooted in ethnography and is primarily concerned with how the everyday use of language structures, and is structured by, socio-cultural forces. In Fundamentals of Linguistic Anthropology, we will pose, and seek to answer, a variety of questions about language and its relationships to culture and society. Possible questions include: Why do children all over the world acquire their first languages at about the same rate and age? How do children learn to use language in culturally specific, culturally appropriate ways? Why do groups of people who apparently share \"the same language\" speak and use it very differently? Does the language that one speaks affect the ways in which one thinks and experiences the world? How and why does a particular language variety come to be regarded as the \"standard\" variety, while others are regarded as \"non-standard\"? How and why does language use relate to important social variables, such as ethnicity, class, gender, age, education, and religion? What is the relationship between language and power? Why and how does cross-cultural miscommunication occur and what are its consequences?

We will begin with a brief theoretical discussion on the connection between folklore, nationalism, and ethnic and regional identity, as well as popular and mass culture. Placing special emphasis on the emergent, unofficial aspects of vernacular culture, we will then examine how different groups communicate and construct their identity through folk narratives, proverbs, and jokes; folk art; spontaneous memorials; displays of the body, yards; the exchange of food; and the performance of music and dance during festivals, parades, and processions. In light of the currency of \"tradition\" and \"heritage\" in the public sphere - in school curricula, state sponsored programs, advertisement and museums - we will also look critically at the production of culture in the context of multiculturalism and identity politics, and the often ambiguous relation established between dominant or elite cultures and unofficial, vernacular cultures. Class discussions will be conducted in a seminar style and complimented with audio-visual materials.

In other words, we will explore the relation between structured choices and agency. From this vantage point we will examine selected issues on nationalism, postcolonialism, modernity, transnationalism, and diaspora, as well as consumption, technology, tradition, heritage, ethnicity, and tourism. The first part of this course will examine the relation between theory and method in anthropological research on cultural globalization, especially the challenges for fieldwork in complex societies. The second part will test their applicability and validity through a close reading of ethnographic works and the screening of videos that examine various dilemmas arising from processes of cultural contact in complex societies. In addition to exploring globalization and localization issues in anthropology, this course should enable students to think through and apply different methodologies in writing their research projects for the course."

Today the social life of media (books, magazines, TV, films, videos, audiocassettes, radio, e-mail, the Internet, telephones, billboards, etc.) is a vibrant and growing topic of interest within anthropology. Some of the questions anthropologists ask: What roles do media play in the circulation, transmission, and contestation of culture? How do media (and new media technologies) affect people's lives, and how do people transform and adapt media to fit their needs? What is the relation of the media to economic and political systems? What can we learn by paying attention to the specific details of how media are produced, used, and talked about?

Human Biology of Modern Populations.  3   Credit Hours.": "An investigation of how advances in genomics have shaped the way physical anthropologists approach the study of living human populations. Students are introduced to basic concepts in the regulation of genetic expression and developmental genetics. Concepts from these two fields are discussed within the framework of evolutionary developmental biology, and we explore the implications of this new synthesis for the evolution of modern humans and modern human variation. Variation caused by changes in developmental timing is explored in terms of genetics (using selection and life history models) and non-genetic (epigenetic, phenotypic plasticity) response pathways to environmental conditions."

Evolutionary Medicine.  3   Credit Hours.": "This course explores the new field of evolutionary medicine which seeks adaptive explanations for why humans as a species are susceptible to certain diseases that are rare among other mammals. The course also asks why certain human populations are susceptible to disease and illness whereas others are not. In contrast, when physicians and biomedical researchers ask \"why\" a patient is sick they usually seek an explanation in the effect of a pathogen, the role of anatomical anomaly, a genetic mutation, exposure to an environmental toxin, the cause of physiological disregulation, or other proximate mechanisms including behavioral and cultural causes. Knowledge of how our biological adaptations and patterns of human biological variation contribute to disease susceptibility is beginning to inform therapeutic approaches in biomedicine and sometimes provokes extraordinary controversy and claims of racism or biological determinism. This course will conclude with a series of discussions and debates about the legitimacy of such critiques after students in the course have learned about evolutionary explanations for disease susceptibility."

The first is to understand the nature of human physiological responses to environmental extremes. Here, in addition to understanding basic physiological responses to nutritional stress, climactic temperature and high altitude hypoxia, we will examine genetic and environmental causes of population differences. We also will critically evaluate adaptive hypotheses used to explain differences between human populations. The second goal is to write a scientific paper in a format acceptable for publication. To accomplish this, students will learn how to formulate and justify a hypothesis related to human physiological variation, develop an appropriate analytical strategy, test the hypothesis using a population-based data set, and interpret the results."

Over the course of the semester, students will explore the ethics of ethnographic field methods, as well as develop and engage an original research project. Course texts address the unique questions raised by distinct fieldwork settings, such as institutional contexts, multi-sited research, the study of elite populations, and marginalized sub-cultures. The book length ethnographies we will read are paired with theoretical texts from which ethnographers draw to develop their arguments. Students will be encouraged to consider how theory can provoke or prevent insight during ethnographic fieldwork. Students will expand their capacity to write well in the specific genres practiced and highly valued by socio-cultural anthropologists. A portion of class time will be devoted to peer writing review, instruction and analysis of ethnographic field notes, and interviewing techniques. Students will interpret their original ethnographic evidence and be asked to hone an argument, moving from practice to theory. Topics, conceptual approaches, and regional specialization will vary.

It investigates how filmmakers from the region narrate, represent and navigate particular historical events and conditions of the region. The films are coupled with readings that provide background and help to facilitate historical, cultural and, at times, aesthetic understandings of the narratives. The narratives begin roughly in the middle of the 20th century, and are arranged thematically - though a sense of historic consequence is evident. The films cover issues such as: feudalism and \"socialist\" revolution; Palestine after 1948 and the consequences in the Arab world; pan-Arabism; women, modernity, and the city; authoritarian states; religious extremism; war; immigration; and identity."

This course examines the internal and external forces which shaped the new state, paying close attention to the role of the communist party. We will use books based on recent archival research, mainly in Vietnam and France, to attempt to move beyond the ideological history and prejudices of the Cold War. Vietnam provides a fascinating case study of a country which was both strongly influenced by the Cold War, but which at the same time itself had a strong influence on the course of international history.

This course considers the traditions and uses of biography and autobiography in Asia, a crucial issue in historiography, by examining traditional approaches to biography and autobiography, and by tracing the evolution of these traditions, as adapted to the needs of modern civil society and state. SECTION 101 (AMBLER): Comparative Revolutions in South and Southeast Asia: Nationalism, Communism, and Tradition. This course examines 20th century transformations of Afghanistan, Indonesia and Vietnam, with an emphasis on the sources of ideas for revolutionary change. We will contrast the role of Western concepts, including those spread to colonial countries via the Communist International in Moscow, with the importance of indigenous beliefs and Asian religions in the revolutions in these three countries.

Too many people? Insufficient technology? How did we get to where we are? Or more immediately--and perhaps deeply--what fundamental beliefs, attitudes, and values shape our everyday actions, how we perceive and use (or misuse) the earth? What creative alternatives can we find, and how can we apply them?

Can we piece together the everyday lives of Greek or Roman women of any social class? Even if we believe in the equality of the sexes, would a word like \"equality\" have had any meaning to the ancients? In this class, we will find answers to these questions by reading Greek and Latin sources in translation as well as the works of modern Classicists. While focusing on women's lives, we will gain a greater understanding of what was expected of both genders in the ancient world."

We will read bestselling detective novels by figures such as Emile Gaboriau, Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, Wilkie Collins, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, Jorge Borges (Argentina), Vikram Chandra (India), Henning Mankell (Sweden), Janwillem van de Wetering (Holland), Kole Omotosho (Nigeria), and Soji Shimada (Japan). We will pay special attention to the conventions of the form and analyze its evolution as it travels the world. In exploring its global travels, we will attend to a number of issues, including: the changing definition of crime; the evolving representation of the criminal; the changing methods for \"solving\" the crime; the ideology of justice; the conflicts between community and individuality; and the varying social and national anxieties that the form reveals.

Are transnational films playing at a theatre near you? Perhaps they are, but if not, why not? Which \"foreign films\" are allowed to cross the border into our country? How, when, and where do we get to \"see the world\" and why does that matter in today's globalized, interconnected world?

Moreover, you should be able to apply what you've learned to critical analysis of various timely and important issues - such as climate change, vulnerability to environmental hazards, and approaches to mitigating and adapting to environmental change. Though this course focuses on the physical environment, the geographic approach is very much about the relationships between humans and their environments, between nature and society.

This course helps us to understand how our everyday consumption patterns are connected to resource production and distribution on a global scale and what the social, environmental, and economic impacts of natural resource production are. To explore the complicated intersection of resource management, economics, and development, we examine the literature on natural resource development, allocation, management, and geopolitics as they relate to economic systems and \"development.\" We draw on case studies that include production for the global market, as well as local subsistence systems. Through these cases, we examine the geography of resource flows, from the sites of extraction to the sites of consumption. We consider the role of technology and capital investment in the production of resources, property institutions and regulatory regimes, commodity chains, and sustainability concerns associated with resource production. The production of and competition for the control of key natural resources, by corporations, societies, and states, are critical processes in constructing the global economy. These processes materially transform the conditions of societies, as well as, contribute to the shaping of those societies, politically and economically."

Using both primary and secondary source materials, as well as films about World Wars I and II, the course looks at the experiences of men and women on the front lines and on the home front, those who participated in the wars and those who resisted them, those who benefited from war and those who participated in the wars and those who resisted them, those who benefited from war and those who were its victims. The course examines not only how wartime experiences construct and revise ideas about gender, but also how the rhetoric of gender is often used to further wartime aims."

This course looks at the presence of minority communities in Germany today, their history and cultural influences as well as economic contributions. Our main analytical lens will be gender - how the German host culture is shaped by concepts of femininity and masculinity, sexuality, family, and a gendered division of labor and how these concepts are challenged (and/or shored up) by the various ethnic communities. We will look at both the perception of migrants by white/native Germans (how are they portrayed in the media, film, and politics?) and we will explore the voice of the \"other,\" i.e. the experience of minority communities living in Germany and how this influences their own cultural identities. Questions we will ask include: How does the experience of immigration affect the identity of minorities living in Germany? What does \"Deutsche Kultur\" (German culture) mean today? Our focus will be on how gender shapes and underlies much of these discussions on minorities in Germany as well as their negotiations of conflicting expectations of community and larger \"German\" culture. Course material will include critical readings, films, and other cultural texts. Taught in English.

Berlin was considered the European capital of artistic and experimental subcultures as well as the hotbed for radical politics, whose decadent Bohemian culture of sexual experimentation, drug use, women's liberation and cabaret existed side by side with abject poverty and street violence. We will ask questions such as how Hitler could come to power in a Germany that was considered to have the most advanced science, technology, literature, philosophy and art of its time, and whose Jewish citizens contributed to all areas of society? How did a new consumerism contribute to the complacency of many Germans in the face of a violent fascism? Thereby we will pay attention to how concepts of race, gender, sexuality and nation shaped the debates of the time. We will watch movies, read literature and graphic novels, and learn about the Weimar Republic's political landscape and history. This course is conducted in English.

This course explores different strategies of constructing masculinities and femininities in pre-modern Christian Europe and asks who/what had the power to universalize and discipline such fabrications. We will study how the papacy and medieval monarchies regulated gender and sexuality among Christians and also between Christians, Jews, Muslims and so-called \"pagans\" from c 500 CE to 1500 CE and in so doing creating a powerful political notion of a territorial \"inside\" called Europe."

Particular focus is on the participation of women in left terrorist and other militant groups in the U.S. and Europe between the 1960s and 1980s, and in the Middle East in the 2000s. Female terrorists and militants in various cultural settings are generally demonized as being more dangerous and violent than their male counterparts or their roles are de-politicized as misguided, seduced lovers of the \"real\" male terrorist. In this course we examine gendered cultural assumptions about women's \"natural\" role as mothers and peacemakers and how these cultural beliefs have been translated into a feminist definition of women's political activism as non-violent.

We will look at both the perception of migrants by white/native Germans (how are they portrayed in the media, film, and politics?) and we will explore the voice of the \"other,\" i.e. the experience of minority communities living in Germany and how this influences their own cultural identities. Questions we will ask include: How does the experience of immigration affect the identity of minorities living in Germany? What does \"Deutsche Kultur\" (German culture) mean today? Our focus will be on how gender shapes and underlies much of these discussions on minorities in Germany as well as their negotiations of conflicting expectations of community and larger \"German\" culture.

We will ask questions such as how Hitler could come to power in a Germany that was considered to have the most advanced science, technology, literature, philosophy and art of its time, and whose Jewish citizens contributed to all areas of society? How did a new consumerism contribute to the complacency of many Germans in the face of a violent fascism? Thereby we will pay attention to how concepts of race, gender, sexuality and nation shaped the debates of the time. We will watch movies, read literature and graphic novels, and learn about the Weimar Republic's political landscape and history. This course is conducted in English. All films are subtitled and readings are in English.

We will look at both the perception of migrants by white/native Germans (how are they portrayed in the media, film, and politics?) and we will explore the voice of the \"other,\" i.e. the experience of minority communities living in Germany and how this influences their own cultural identities. Questions we will ask include: How does the experience of immigration affect the identity of minorities living in Germany? What does \"Deutsche Kultur\" (German culture) mean today?

It argues that there is no modernity and no globalization without slavery. Explore this problem by asking a basic question: By what techniques, abstract and concrete, do masters make themselves as visible by constructing slaves as invisible?

This course will provide you with the tools you need to find out. The course focuses on world politics over the past century, up to today. We will examine a number of key global problems as they have changed over time. We will adopt an historical approach, which means we will read texts and documents about the past as a way to understand the present. Together we will explore debates like: Is America an empire? What is ideology and is it a factor in world politics today? What role do diplomacy, strategy, and military power play in world affairs? How have non-western peoples and states challenged the power of the West, and with what results? What are the roots of ethnic and religious conflict? And what can we as citizens do to address truly global problems? Drawing on examples from 20th century world history, this course introduces you to world politics and the great debates of our time.

Is there a great discrepancy between myth and reality? What does our view of the past say about the present? In what ways can Philadelphia be viewed as a microcosm of the United States and in what ways does the development of Philadelphia, through political turmoil, industrial growth, and the creation of ethnic neighborhoods by a constant flood of immigrants tie in with global developments?"

For millions of people throughout history, this is not just an academic question but a lived reality. In this class, you will confront the realities of empire, and you will observe ways that many others have confronted empire in the past. To find out what empire means, this class will introduce students to Asian, African and Latin American people whose lives have been shaped by Western colonial rule from the 18th to the 20th centuries. What was it like to live as a colonized person in the age of empire? What kind of power did one have to lead a free life? What sorts of opposition and resistance was available to colonized peoples? How has the struggle between colonized peoples and the powerful imperial states shaped the world we live in today? And do we still live in a world that has colonial dimensions to it? In this class, we will listen to the voices of those who experienced Western imperialism and follow them as they confronted and challenged that process. We bring together a variety of sources including speeches, newspapers, novels, films, and government documents to reconstruct specific moments of collective action on the part of the colonized. We will explore how this struggle carries on today. NOTE: This course fulfills the World Society (GG) requirement for students under GenEd and International Studies (IS) for students under Core."

By 1776, the United States of America was formed under promises of liberty, equality, property rights, and tolerance. But who would benefit? Who should rule? Partial industrialization, the consolidation of slavery, agricultural specialization, and expansion to the west, along with demands for reform and democracy, made these questions ever more vexed and led to a Civil War and a flawed attempt to reconstitute the Union by 1877.

This is a course that uses the game of baseball to try to make sense of a complicated last 175 years of American history. It is a course about the place of baseball in American society and how the game both reflected and influenced American society. We will examine issues of race, gender, class, immigration, suburbanization, urban planning, capitalism, and identity in American history using America's National Pastime, baseball, as our lens. You do not need to love (or even understand) baseball to enjoy this class. All you need is a curiosity about the American past!"

This course will examine how soccer's past and present connect to forces and trends that have shaped history since the modern game's \"invention\" in England in 1863. Soccer tells us about race, economics, empire, gender, and of course sports in the modern world. It is connected to nation and tradition, to international business, to organized crime, to hooligan violence. Readings and assignments drawn from Europe, South America, Africa, and the United States will inform expert and novice students alike about \"the beautiful game\" (as it is known in Portuguese) and at the same time the world around them."

It begins by surveying the history of the field and its various realms of professional practice. Subsequent units concern the challenges of doing history with diverse audiences, the value of historical interpretation in public contexts, and best practices for public historians. Throughout, special emphasis is placed on issues such as historical resource management, museum practice, digital history, and other facets of the dissemination of public memory. Students discover who manages our shared heritage while learning to think critically about its place in society. And because Philadelphia has figured so prominently in the history and practice of public history, the city will play a central role in readings and assignments."

Although our focus will sometimes be theoretical--especially with regard to the philosophy of collecting, the construction of memory, and competing concepts of the \"public\"--we will also consider the practicalities of museum management with an eye toward exploring career paths for students. Philadelphia is itself a museum of museums and will therefore provide the backdrop for our investigation. As a result, we will pay particular attention to the history of the museum in America and especially the place of history museums in shaping our ideas about the nation's past and its future."

Students will be introduced to a number of skills aimed at making them better able to understand the current American economy, to the use of historical data as a means of judging current trends in finance and business, and to some of the major web sites and journal literature on the subject. They will make written and oral presentations in which they defend their ideas, take a mid-term and a final exam, both of which will require students to answer essay questions, and write a short paper (10-15 pages) on a historical topic dealing with business or economic issues."

But there is a long history of people defined as black living in Europe and contributing to European nation-states. If we focus our attention on their stories, we can see the fragility of the white identity in Europe. The goal of this course is to explore a deeper history of black lives in modern Europe than we see presented in the news. Through a combination of primary sources, history books, fiction, and movies, we will discover what it has meant to be black in various countries since the late eighteenth century. In the process, we will question the historical basis of a white identity in the European region."

The traditional courses on European history have relied on an understanding of European politics that divides the continent between east and west, and relies on Great Power perspectives. Using the concept of Central Europe, and the ways that it has been interpreted, this course encourages students to restore Central and Eastern Europe to the broader histories of the continent. Narratives of Eastern European peoples, Germans, Slavs, Hungarians, and others, were defined by the struggle between forces of nationalism and geopolitical realities, conflicting desires of sovereignty and security, freedom and social justice. This region, now part of the European Union, is rich in history and culture, as well as cultural and religious diversity.

As we study environmental histories of China, Japan, and Taiwan, we will have the chance to consider how patterns of environmental and social change in East Asian societies set them apart from other places around the world.

Yet at the beginning of the 19th century, Europeans increasingly described North Africa - and its people - as starkly foreign, wholly 'other'. This course will examine European and North African interactions over the period of 1798 to the present, with a particular focus on European invasions and colonizations - including Napoleon in Egypt, Lyautey in Morocco, and Mussolini in Libya. How did Europeans shape North African history and how did colonizing North Africa form modern European institutions and ideas? The class will examine these questions by focusing on both sides of the Mediterranean 'divide', including recent debates in Europe on North African immigrants, political invocations of Islam, and Islamophobia."

The vicarious experience of battle leaves strong impressions on the viewer, more often than not mixing fact and fallacy in ways that create a particular, peculiar notion of historical reality. This course will examine war films from the United States, Germany, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union to see how these cinematic representations actually make important historical arguments about hotly contested topics such as the nature, meaning, and causes of war, moral responsibility for atrocities committed in war, and other issues. Students will be expected to view the films outside of class time, which will be devoted to brief lectures and discussions of the issues the films raise."

It led to the destruction of empires, the outbreak of revolutions, and gave rise to Communism, Fascism and Nazism. The war catapulted the United States into a position of global dominance that it still maintains today. The war also transformed modern arts and culture. This course surveys not just the military history of the conflict, but its political, social, and cultural impact on Europe, the Middle East, the United States, Africa, and Asia.

Ideas about gender - i.e., how masculinity and femininity are defined - are frequently subject to radical revision in the context of a society at war. This course examines the European and, to a lesser extent, the American experiences of war during the two World Wars and the intervening 20 year period, to understand how war and ideas of gender are related. Using both primary and secondary source materials, as well as films about World Wars I and II, the course looks at the experiences of men and women on the front lines and on the home front, those who participated in the wars and those who resisted them, those who benefited from war and those who were its victims. The course examines not only how wartime experiences construct and revise ideas about gender, but also how the rhetoric of gender is often used to further wartime aims."

Development of the Modern American City.  3   Credit Hours.": "The course examines the way that the American city has undergone two revolutionary changes in the 135 years since the Civil War. In the mid- to late 19th century the city went from a walking city to a streetcar city, altering the basic social and economic geography. Then in the 20th century American cities were transformed from streetcar cities to automobile cities, again revolutionizing the cities' basic geography. The two transformations were rooted in technological innovation in such areas as transportation, power, and building construction. But the changes also depended upon what American urban dwellers chose to make of the technologies. History, by examining the way that American cities have changed in the past, can illuminate what the American city has become and thus can provide insight into the factors that should be taken into account in influencing the future of cities."

The second aspect is the way that underworld activities both reflect and influence the wider society. The course, then, examines the interrelationships of crime, on the one hand, and ethnic groups, neighborhood structure, urban politics, criminal justice institutions, the rise of professional sports, the changing sexual mores of the society, and even such aspects as the changing role of the family and the impact of technology. Crime becomes a prism through which students will learn about the history of American urban society."

Media and American Culture, 1706-Present.  3   Credit Hours.": "This course will explore the role of media in the development of American popular culture, with particular emphasis on the cultural transformations brought about by mass media after 1880. Historical analysis will demonstrate the profound shift in media roles within the past century; from media expressions of popular culture before 1889, to media as generators of popular culture after that point. A by-product of this analysis will be the formulation of a critical definition of mass media in terms of a specific relationship between the media and the audience."

Race has played a very important role in the lives of black people and in the history of African Americans. Historically the black church has been a central institution for addressing pressing societal issues that threaten the existence of black people. African Methodism, the first major black Christian organization came into existence as a liberation movement and a protest against racism and segregation in the Christian Church. Utilizing selected historic periods, i.e., ante-bellum, Civil War and Reconstruction, the 1920s and 1930s, and the 1960s, this course will explore the meaning of freedom and liberation as defined by the historic African American church and its leadership, and will examine the different ideologies and strategies employed by church leaders in addressing and resolving issues regarding the individual and collective freedom of black people. American and African American history will be used as the context, for examining issues, events, movements and personalities important to understanding the role and impact of the black church on the development of liberationist black thought and movements during different periods."

These themes include the ideological, strategic, economic, cultural, and racial influences on America's foreign relations; mission, manifest destiny, and continental expansion; issues of war, peace, and security; crisis management and mismanagement; the closing frontier and imperialism; Wilsonianism and its critics; independent internationalism; and personal versus coalition diplomacy. Because the study of diplomatic history is highly interpretative, and the assigned studies reflect competing interpretations, all students will be expected to question, comment upon, and yes, even criticize the readings and lectures. In doing so, emphasis will be placed on recognizing and assessing the strategies historians employ to collect and use evidence in order to advance arguments. Students will be required to \"volunteer\" at the start of each session to summarize briefly and cogently the primary issues and arguments covered in the preceding one, and students should be prepared to respond to questions and references to the readings that will be incorporated into each session's lectures."

This course looks at the presence of minority communities in Germany today, their history and cultural influences as well as economic contributions. Our main analytical lens will be gender - how the German host culture is shaped by concepts of femininity and masculinity, sexuality, family, and a gendered division of labor and how these concepts are challenged (and/or shored up) by the various ethnic communities. We will look at both the perception of migrants by white/native Germans (how are they portrayed in the media, film, and politics?) and we will explore the voice of the \"other\", i.e. the experience of minority communities living in Germany and how this influences their own cultural identities. Questions we will ask include: How does the experience of immigration affect the identity of minorities living in Germany? What does \"Deutsche Kultur\" (German culture) mean today? Our focus will be on how gender shapes and underlies much of these discussions on minorities in Germany as well as their negotiations of conflicting expectations of community and larger \"German\" culture. Course material will include critical readings, films, and other cultural texts. Taught in English."

Berlin was considered the European capital of artistic and experimental subcultures as well as the hotbed for radical politics, whose decadent Bohemian culture of sexual experimentation, drug use, women's liberation and cabaret existed side by side with abject poverty and street violence. We will ask questions such as how Hitler could come to power in a Germany that was considered to have the most advanced science, technology, literature, philosophy and art of its time, and whose Jewish citizens contributed to all areas of society? How did a new consumerism contribute to the complacency of many Germans in the face of a violent fascism? Thereby we will pay attention to how concepts of race, gender, sexuality and nation shaped the debates of the time. We will watch movies, read literature and graphic novels, and learn about the Weimar Republic's political landscape and history. This course is conducted in English.

With more than 150,000,000 people, Brazil is second in population among western hemisphere nations to the United States, and far larger than any Latin American nation. Brazilians can claim national unity solidly based on a common language and common cultural heritage. Brazilians are descended from Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans, but can claim a recent history relatively free of ethnic or racial strife. Brazil is rich in natural resources, and has one of the world's few natural resource frontiers. Finally, Brazil continues to produce outstanding architects, artists, writers, composers, social scientists and legal intellectuals, religious and political leaders, entrepreneurs and athletes. At the same time, persistent problems block Brazilian development. They include widespread racism and class bias, excessive dependence on foreign capital and technology, a shamefully inadequate public school system, a perverse distribution of income that favors the wealthy, and fragile democratic institutions. After 500 years of history, Brazilians have immense tasks before them, while the promise of national greatness remains unfulfilled."

Its complex and fascinating history is the product of different worlds and cultures coming together in the 16th century. In this course we will analyze this encounter and its consequences by looking at two main topics: race and gender. Following a chronological order that starts with the conquest of the Americas by the Spaniards and Portuguese in the 16th century and ends with the breakdown of the Spanish empire in the early nineteenth century, the course will explore the ways in which different peoples have interacted. We will discuss the various roles men and women assumed in these societies and the significance of race. In so doing, we will attempt a deeper analysis of the social dynamics of Latin America in the past that will give us a better understanding of its present and future.

Historiography and Research Methods.  3   Credit Hours.": "Each generation of historians reinterprets and rewrites the past according to the political and social views of its time. When we read history we learn just as much, if not more, about the times in which the historian is writing as we learn about the era he/she is writing about. Historical facts do not change, but the choice of which facts are to be emphasized and the interpretation of those facts reflect the Zeitgeist of the historian. A further complicating issue is that there are also many differences of opinion within each generation, debates over the basic issue of history as consensus or history as conflict. This course will introduce students to the various ways professional historians have interpreted and written about the past, from 19th century German historian Leopold von Ranke's association of history with scientific objective (wie es eigentlich gewesen), through the challenges of progressivism, relativism, universalism, and particularism. Is history the study of the past for its own sake or should historians turn on the past, as Carl Becker observed, and use it to influence the present? Students will also be trained in the types of research methods and archival research employed by professional historians and the problems historians encounter in evaluating and interpreting historical sources. This is an intensive reading seminar that will be conducted chiefly through discussion. There will be lectures on the evolution of historiography as well as lectures on research methods. Members of the class will be expected to do demanding work each week reading the assignments, preparing papers, and leading discussions on the results of their weekly research and writing."

In this course, students will learn the most up-to-date information of Japanese society and develop their reading skills and comprehension by reading newspapers. To achieve those goals, the course is divided into two parts. The first half of the course will be devoted to developing reading skills and building lexicon necessary to understand newspaper articles as well as the stylistics and format characteristic of newspapers (e.g., the use of abbreviations and technical terms in the headlines and leads). In order to increase readiness for reading newspapers, students will read 5-7 short passages a day (with a complete vocabulary list) on a variety of topics. Students' acquisition of new vocabulary and expressions will be tested on a daily basis. In the second half of the semester, students will read Japanese newspaper articles weekly. Each week, two articles will be chosen for a class reading followed by discussions. In addition, each student will choose an article for a weekly oral report.

In this introductory course on the Caribbean we will critically examine \"creolization\" processes at social, religious, political, economic, and artistic levels as they were driven by various groups, from pirates, privateers, maroons, exiles, to tourists, in the context of colonialism, nation building, and globalization. Examining specific sites such as music, display events, folklore, and religion we will ponder about, for instance, the effects of European revolutions on the creation of elites in the Caribbean, and the impact of slave cultures and peasantries on the formation of creole religions. How has the image of the sensuous/threatening mulatta evolved since the plantation? On what kind of histories and emotions do \"zombies\" feed upon? Why did Reggae and Merenge succeed on the global stage? How does the display of national icons in Trinidadian carnival reflect on their socio-political conflicts?

California has been, at once, the golden gate of opportunity and the grapes of wrath of the downtrodden; social mobility and the policy of incarceration, the glamour of Hollywood and monotony of tract housing, the high-tech of Silicon Valley and the high-sweat of agricultural labor, the Eden of natural bounty and the ecological disaster of sprawl and smog. This course concentrates on the historical role that categories of race have played in defining by whose means, to whose benefit, and in whose image California's wealth would be produced and consumed.

The sociology of Latin American music usually followed the theoretical developments occurring in the industrialized countries of the West, but, at the same time, it was characterized by a peculiar twist in the way it understood the complex relationship between music and society. In this course we delve into this important literature and grapple with the social and cultural foundations of music, with particular emphasis on the relationship between music and society in Brazil and Argentina. Due to the complex social organization of these two countries in terms of race, ethnicity, regionalisms, class, gender and religion, the course will explore the articulation of that complexity in the way people use music in their everyday life to understand who they are and what to do in the context of an ever changing social reality."

These processes encompass a multitude of mechanisms by which DNA is regulated, all of which are independent of DNA mutation. Epigenetic modifications are highly dynamic and respond quickly to environmental changes, such as diet or stress. Epigenetic marks represent concrete mechanisms for the long-held idea that biology and behavior are shaped by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Some of these epigenetic marks are passed on to future generations via the germline and influence neuroprogramming in the next generation offspring. In the brain, where most neurons are post-mitotic, epigenetic processes play a critical role in regulating gene expression and synaptic plasticity, which are pivotal events for the regulation of behavior."

Nearly one out of every six people in the world resides in India.

The course begins by briefly discussing India's contemporary political institutions. Next, the course provides a historical overview of India's modern history, before turning to a variety of issues of contemporary relevance: ethnicity, violence, corruption, elections, and democracy."

Meanings are not regarded as inherent in objects but rather as emerging from interactions among humans and between humans and their environments. The self, which plays a pivotal role in human interaction, is both a product and a force of social life. This course is divided into three parts. In Part 1, we conceptualize the self as a symbolic object that emerges from social interaction. In Part 2, we examine the origin of the self, the \"true self,\" identity construction, self and autism, as well as other related issues.

Can we make alternative food choices and support food-oriented social change that help create a more equitable, sustainable, healthy and delicious world? This course raises these and other sociological questions about food and food systems, critically examining some of the answers that sociologists and other social scientists have provided. The focus will be on the U.S., but a range of relevant global issues and case studies will be addressed."

Among the sub-themes of kinship we shall consider are: the state and public policy as it relates to family formation; sexuality, intimate relations and parenting; the division of labor and social power within families; and their variations across the globe. We'll also devote a portion of our time to applying the material to an understanding of where our own families fit into this material. That is, we will relate our own and classmates' family biographies to the broader social history of American families. Applying theoretical concepts to real cases is often the most effective way of understanding them and examining their usefulness and plausibility.

As a result, entrance exams for health professions schools test the ability to think and solve problems logically. However, the techniques of good problem solving are rarely explicitly taught at any point in a student's education, and science majors rarely take logic courses. This course seeks to fill that gap in a way that is geared specifically toward what is needed for pre-health students to succeed in their classes and on standardized tests. This course teaches students good problem-solving techniques and the basics of deductive and inductive logic. The students will spend class time practicing and applying the techniques and principles they are taught, either individually or in pairs/groups. This design will enable them to develop their skills of problem solving and logical thinking so that they can apply them not only to their classes, but to entrance exams for professional school and the practice of their profession as well."

It provides a forum that allows an instructor to assess the student's overall collegiate learning experience. Students are assumed to have gained adequate computer language (C and Java in particular) and programming skills in their early-year curriculum. As this is a writing-intensive course, students are required to submit written assignments that go through an iterative writing cycle: a student submits an assignment, the instructor gives feedback on the assignment, student revises and resubmits work, and the instructor assigns a grade for the revised version. Writing assignments in this course will be grounded in the expression of technical computer science concepts and are designed to help students to develop and practice skills in writing for the computer science discipline."

In this GenEd course we explore the myriad of ways in which racial and gender stereotypes have affected our perception of what it means to be an accomplished scientist. When we think of influential scientists, the names Claudia Alexander and Carolyn Parker should come as easily to the mind as Buzz Aldrin or Thomas Edison. We will discuss how the public perceives science and scientists, and explore the implications of this in terms of how science serves a diverse society. We will also explore the ways in which violence and misogyny have impacted our digital world. Technology and science change our society; who authors this change influences how we participate in the process and the cultural narrative of who innovates and leads our society, which is critical to the current controversy of science in politics."

Environmental Life Cycle Analysis: Does Buying \"Green\" Matter?.  4   Credit Hours.": "With increasing societal awareness of environmental sustainability, many industry and business sectors have prioritized the development and application of green technology and/or green processes over the course of a product's life span. Life cycle analysis (LCA) is a scientific methodology that systematically examines both cumulative and potential environmental impacts of a product over its entire life cycle, ranging from the extraction of raw Earth materials to its disposal when all the materials ultimately return to the Earth. LCA can also provide comparative impacts among the different products, and both companies and consumers benefit from the environmental rating systems for their marketing and decision making processes. Through this course, we will learn how LCA model works in detail, using real-world examples, such as paper vs plastic bags, cathode ray tube (CRT) vs liquid crystal display (LCD) technology, as well as electronic wastes."

This course takes this idea to the streets as students identify an opportunity and work alone or in small teams to launch a business, pivot and adapt to real-time evidence gathered, and become profitable all during a single semester. Although not all students will launch their dream venture in this short time, they may be able to create a business that provides passive income, lets them exit by selling a profitable venture to someone, or allows them to save money to start their next venture. However, more than anything the real learning (and fun) begins once you get out of your head and the classroom to actually launch a business."

If you work in any organization or want to start a new venture of your own it is critical that you prioritize \"purpose\" or create \"meaning.\" Organizations that ignore their impact on society and the world miss out on opportunities for innovation as well as the immense competitive advantage to having a positive social impact (i.e., doing good) while you do well. If you make meaning you will make people want to write stories about you, want to work for you, and want to buy from you. This course will explore the various ways the emerging U.S. social enterprise sector is evolving.

In addition, the BP is frequently underappreciated as a vital instrument for existing businesses. Senior managers often evaluate a potential departure from existing business models by engaging multiple internal stakeholders, hiring consultants, benchmarking and establishing milestones--as momentum builds the process takes on a life of its own. Ultimately, a great deal could have been saved if a BP had been created from the start. This course teaches students a very practical skill--the know-how to fully develop and flesh-out an innovative new business model via a business plan.

The course will expose students to the history of the region including indigenous cultures before European exploration, European arrivals and conceptions of the \"New World\", plantation economies from sugar to coffee, the transatlantic slave trade, the Haitian Revolution, art of maroon communities, and the syncretism of African religious practices in Afro-Caribbean faiths like Vodoun and Santeria. Throughout the semester, we will examine definitions of the term \"Caribbean\". For example, is the term limited geographically to the Caribbean basin or should it take on a more cultural valence, expanding to places like Louisiana and Brazil, both of which share significant historical and cultural similarities with the countries from the Caribbean basin. Major themes of the class will include the impacts of colonialism, the transatlantic slave trade, the formation of the Afro-Atlantic diaspora, and legacies of the transatlantic slave trade in contemporary art."

Students will study how artists broke from the concept of art as mimesis as a way to represent their own experiences of modernity. To explore these experiences, topics such as urban life, technological innovations, revolution and war, and histories of colonization will be discussed. Considering the focus of the class on global modern art, we will compare how its genres and styles traveled, often unevenly, across the world, questioning the role of center and periphery in its development.

What role has art played in constructing an image of our environment as natural resource, scientific specimen, mythic Eden, arena of struggle, and/or fragile ecosystem? Can art and art history help envision a more sustainable world or are they part of the problem? As a way of addressing such questions, this course takes an \"ecocritical\" perspective on American art from the late 19th century (when the word \"ecology\" first appeared) to the present. More than any other single nation, the United States bears responsibility for the ecological challenges facing our planet, even as its citizens arguably enjoy unparalleled opportunities for creative freedom. By highlighting the interconnectedness of human beings with their environment in America, as well as the power of art to re-imagine that relationship, the course provokes students to re-think accepted canons and practices in light of other criteria having to do with sustainability, environmental justice, and our ethical responsibility to non-human life. Covering a wide range of artists and media - from the Romantic paintings and writings of Thomas Cole and John James Audubon to more recent work by Edward Burtynsky, Subhankar Banerjee, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Robert Smithson, Helen and Newton Harrison, Eduardo Kac, Alexis Rockman, Mark Dion and other contemporary artists active in this country - the course gives students a new and richly diverse opportunity to think about American art.

Premised on an understanding that Tokyo's changing urban environment shaped the artistic practices of the time, this course thematically explores some of the major theoretical issues that surround contemporary Japanese art and visual culture of the period. Critical readings will provide social, historical, and political contexts for understanding a broad range of visual cultural practices including art, design, and film. While Japan's postwar \"miraculous\" economic growth was accompanied by conservative ideals such as the homogenous middle class and contemporaneous urban developments reorganized the city to promote market activity, the 1960s and 1970s were also extremely productive decades for the arts. Alongside increased political activism and direct action by students and workers, who took to the streets, new developments in street performances, experimental theater works, graphic design, experimental cinema, and underground comics would irrevocably change the course of Japanese visual culture. Paying attention to the thick connections between artists working in various media of the time, we will explore how Tokyo both shaped the artists and their works and served as their subject.

Modern Japanese Art and Visual Culture, from late Edo to Showa.  4   Credit Hours.": "This course will examine Japanese visual expressions created from ca. 1720 during the Edo period to 1956 during the Showa period. This span of time can be characterized by Japan's modernization efforts and engagement in wars, beginning with the lifting of the ban on western books after almost 200 years of isolation from the outside world. This policy change triggered an influx of European thought into Japan and ensuing westernization as Japan faced the imperialist powers of Europe. Thereafter, Japan experienced two watershed events pertaining to the West: the collapse of centuries-old samurai feudalism in 1868 and Japan's defeat in the Second World War in 1945. In the development of Japanese modern visual arts, Western knowledge and culture played a crucial role, and often challenged Japan's long-standing traditional values and artistic practices. The course will explore the transformation that Japanese visual arts experienced against the backdrop of political and social upheaval of this period. Japan struggled to keep up with an increasingly globalizing world. Japanese artists had to question and gauge their own artistic practice and style to cope with internal and external factors. After the defeat by the Western Allies in the Second World War, Japanese artists again struggled to find their voices in society. As a Writing Intensive Art History course, students will be instructed on proper research and writing in the discipline and will prepare and refine a research paper."

We will begin looking at some prominent fakes that took in scholars (the Metropolitan's \"Etruscan\" Warriors), talk about when something becomes a fake, and problematic pieces that are still on display. Fakes are made because there is so much money in the art market, and we will see how this market developed. In doing so we will see how Napoleon's policies ultimately lead to the looting on a massive scale in Nazi Germany; discuss the modern development of international law on looting and the protection of antiquities; and argue about what is the United States' responsibility in Iraq now. Finally, we will look at various means of how governments try to protect their antiquities (paying attention to the real-life soap operas like the Lydian Hoard); what is the role of museums in protecting antiquities (looking at the major news story on the indictment of the curator of the Getty, and the return of the stolen Euphronios vase by the Metropolitan Museum); what dealers do; and how an ethical collector can pursue his/her hobby responsibly.

This class brings together students working across all media. You will be responsible for your own research, and for finding a place to create the work. While pursuing studio projects you will also be completing writing assignments. The writing projects are designed to make you aware of different approaches to writing in the visual arts. You will create a proposal for your studio projects and a research paper. The challenge to writing about art is to clearly define the artist\u2019s choices, techniques, medium and personal vision. You are translating the visual into language. Details are a critical part of the descriptive process, using the vocabulary of the discipline of art making. Clarity, organization and a command of grammar and style will be key to creating a successful research paper."
